# AI Chat API

## Overview

The **AI Chat API** hosted at [ai.shujaurrahman.me](https://ai.shujaurrahman.me) is a web service designed to provide intelligent responses in the context of the portfolio website of Shujaur Rahman. This API utilizes the Vercel-hosted AI service as a proxy to fetch responses from the Hugging Face API, leveraging a custom context to ensure that responses are relevant and tailored to the user's inquiries.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this API is to create an interactive chat experience where users can ask questions and receive answers that reflect the expertise and personality of Shujaur Rahman. By utilizing a JSON context file, the API enhances the quality and relevance of the responses generated by the AI model.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user sends a message to the API through a chat interface.
2. **Vercel Proxy**: The request is sent to the Vercel API, which acts as a proxy to the Hugging Face AI model.
3. **AI Response**: The AI generates a response based on the user's message and the context provided in the JSON file.
4. **Return Response**: The response is sent back to the user through the chat interface.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Chat Endpoint

- **URL**: `https://ai-api-vert.vercel.app/api/chat`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `message`: The user's message (required).
  
#### Example Request

```http
GET https://ai-api-vert.vercel.app/api/chat?message=hey
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "message": "Hey, I am Shujaur Rahman AI! How can I assist you today?"
}
```

### 2. Contextual AI Response

The API is designed to provide responses in the context of the user's portfolio, and the AI will respond as "Shuja." The context is defined in the `combined.json` file, which can be improved and fine-tuned to enhance the response quality over time.

#### Example Usage

1. **User Input**: The user sends a message like "Tell me about your projects."
2. **API Call**: The chat frontend makes a call to the Vercel API endpoint with the user's message.
3. **Response**: The API responds with a message that reflects Shujaur Rahman's projects based on the context provided.

## Future Improvements

This implementation is a prototype, and ongoing efforts will focus on:

- Improving the `combined.json` context file for better AI responses.
- Fine-tuning the AI model to enhance its conversational abilities.
- Adding more features and functionalities to the chat interface.

## Conclusion

The AI Chat API is a step towards creating an engaging user experience by leveraging AI technology to provide insightful responses in the context of Shujaur Rahman's work. With continuous improvements, this service aims to become a valuable resource for users seeking information about Shujaur Rahman's portfolio and expertise.
